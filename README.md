# Picture in Picture

A Picture-in-Picture demo app built with vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

This app requests access to screen capture your computer's entire screen, window or browser tab, to stream that into a little picture in picture video player after pressing the "Start!" button.

For the screen capture, it uses the browser's [Screen Capture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API).

For requesting the picture in picture, it uses the browser's [Picture-in-Picture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Picture-in-Picture_API).

**Note:** This app was tested successfully in Google Chrome Desktop and it seems that it only works there for now (20220520).
